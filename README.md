What is Local Web Search Engine?

What is Web Search Engine?

  If you want any information from internet then you directly go to any web search engine like google,yahoo,bing etc..
  If you want any information from your university local websites then you will ask your friend for ip address or some local domain name then after you will search for related url it takes so much time and some times relevant information may not be obtained. To overcome this drawback we are started a project "LOCAL WEB SEARCH ENGINE" which automatically crawls all webpages in the all web servers in local network and store in database. When user entered query then query processor will find the related pages and documents from the database. To sort the results we need to use Page Ranking Algorithm .
